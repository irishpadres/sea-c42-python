Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

Problem 3:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 38, in <module>
      linenum = linenum + 1
      NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

This failed because linenum was defined as a variable

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
AT-content 0.5689938518518518

Problem 5:

G-content: 5738773
A-content 7701287
C-content: 5879128
T-content 7661547

Problem 6:

sample_1.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
sample_2.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
sample_3.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
sample_4.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
sample_5.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
sample_6.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
test-high-gc-1.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
test-high-gc-2.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
test-moderate-gc-1.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
test-moderate-gc-2.fastq: sum differs from total_count and seq
test-small.fastq: all values are the same
The reason for the difference is there is a value N in all files that is not caught by the current logic
The sum should be used as the denominator since that is the true length of the genetic code.

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

GC Classification: moderate GC content

Collaboration:

No one helped me with this. Call me Maverick

Reflection:

Nothing too challenging about this assignment.  It was pretty straightforward
